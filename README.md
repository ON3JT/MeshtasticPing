# Meshtastic Ping (work in progress)

This is my first Python script for Meshtastic. I created this script to help me in testing different antennas from a remote location.
To do this you'll have to record the RSSI for each antenna under test. But how?
This script will help you to do that without activating the Range test option.


## How?

To test antennas, you need :
- a transmittter
- a receiver
- lots of antennas
- free open space without obstacles
